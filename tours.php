                            <p>The original Dillon Cemetery was established in 1885 and was the only graveyard patented under federal law, its patent signed June 30, 1901 by President McKinley. During the construction of the Dillon Dam in 1962 the original cemetery was moved from its first location to its present "home".</p>
                            
                            <p>Interred here are many who were important to the development of the north end of Summit County: members of the families of four of the eight drivers of the High Line Stage Coach Route from Georgetown to Leadville, which operated from 1879 until the arrival of the railroad in 1882; administrative and operating personnel of the narrow-gauge railroads; miners; timbermen and other sawmill workers; blacksmiths; tradesmen, hotel keepers and livery operators; homesteaders and ranchers; road builders, and county officials. One "colored," Dillon town marshal Steve Edwards, was moved, at his death said to be the oldest citizen in the county.</p>
