		<h1><font face='Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'>Dillon Schoolhouse</font></h1>
		<p>When you think of movable schools, you probably think of modular classrooms. Well, think bigger, much bigger. In 1962, this L-shaped schoolhouse was separated into two structures, loaded onto flatbed trucks and moved from Dillon #3, now at the bottom of Lake Dillon.</p>

		<p>Built in 1883 as a school, this frame building with original belfry and bell has undergone changes in use - originally as a school, in 1910 as a church and in 1972 as a museum - as well as in location. The railroad had arrived in Dillon #3 months before the school was constructed, so it was built of modern materials such as four-by-four casement windows and a pressed-tin ceiling. It sported a raised platform with curtain for programs. The outside walls were clapboarded and the roof covered with split-shake shingles.</p>

		<p>Turn-of-the-century artifacts fill the museum. In the one-room classroom are McGuffy desks, Heath Readers (with hand-crocheted bookmarks), slates and chalk, individual learning stations (rolls), Centennial flag, flip chart, black constellation globe, kerosene slide projector and glass slides, phonograph, piano, organ and sand table. Other artifacts in the classroom and adjacent "store" include clothing and jewelry, coffee grinder, post office boxes, buttons, beaver traps, snowshoes, blacksmith tools, assay scales, ballot box, cigar mold and tobacco cutter, saddles and butcher block.</p>

		<p>It is one of two archival facilities in the county housing Historical Society materials, including: newspapers, books, brochures, maps, photographs, governmental documents, clothing, correspondence and more.</p>

		<p><strong>Dillon Schoolhouse Directions:</strong> The Dillon Schoolhouse is located at 403 La Bonte Street, Dillon.</p>
