                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>The Summit Historical Society has a large number of archival materials and artifacts in its possession. Its holdings of historical Summit County photographs, maps, and government documents are extensive. Similarly, there is a growing collection of biographical data concerning Summit County figures. Once estimated at 17,000 separate items, the Society's artifacts collection is enormous and is still growing. Many items are either on display in the Society's properties or are on loan in the area for public view.</p>

                    <h3>For research involving geology (like mines and mining) go to</h3>

                    <p>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) http://library.usgs.gov They have two pertinent websites:</p>


                    <ul>
                        <li>http://www.cr.usgs.gov/fieldrecords is the archive of materials generated by scientists during their project work.  These can be searched by keywords of "summit county, colorado" or specific mines and are very detailed and technical.  The reports and maps are located at the Federal Center in Lakewood, CO, at the USGS Library and you can make copies for free while there.</li>
                        <li>http://libraryphoto.cr.usgs.gov which gives access to the more than 37,000 online of the over 500,000 photos taken during geological studies starting in 1868 and most have never been published.  These are of high quality and can be downloaded directly.  As above, research is done through keywords by county or specific mine.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Arthur Lakes Library at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden has many maps of Summit County mining areas which can be searched at http://library.mines.edu (or Ask A Librarian at libref@mines.edu) and can be copied (11" x 17") on site, but with their library card ($45) all maps can be checked out and taken to local print shops for copying.  Again, keyword searches by county or specific mine can be done.  Their photo collection is in the process of being cataloged.</p>
                     

                    <h3>For records of water rights like irrigation/mining ditches and wells go to</h3>

                    <p>www.water.state.co.us</p>

                    <ul>
                         <li>Go to "Quick LInks" (upper right) and click on "CDSS"</li>
                         <li>"View Data" (upper left), then "Water Rights", and limit data under "Entire State" down to "Div 5 Colorado" and "36 - Blue River Basin"</li>
                         <li>Your search can be done either by name of feature or legal location using Section, Township/Range (this is a real help).  The "Help" section is very useful.  Once the list is provided, click on the document icon at the beginning of the line and you will view the actual record, which may be long since it is a legal document and combined with many other claims in that court.</li>
                     </ul>
